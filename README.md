### Greetings ðŸ‘‹
<!-- **ChulanZhang/ChulanZhang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ˜„ I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student and a Research Assistant in the [Innovatory for Cells and Neural Machines (ICAN)](https://schaterji.io/research/) lab and [Dependable Computing Systems Laboratory (DCSL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) at Purdue University, advised by Professor [Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/) and Professor [Saurabh Bagchi](https://bagchi.github.io/). My research interests include optimizing performance and energy consumption for edge systems. Recently, I worked on several research projects that target optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of two technologies: computer vision at the edge and Internet of Things (IoT) networks. I love to use my knowledge to solve real-world problems. Specifically, I enjoy researching, developing, and deploying cutting-edge intelligent systems around us. I hope to optimize such systems' latency/accuracy/energy performance and lead to a sustainable environment.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking for an internship position to develop and deploy adaptive and innovative Machine Learning systems in real-world applications.
