### Greetings ðŸ‘‹
<!-- **ChulanZhang/ChulanZhang** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->
<!-- Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ˜„ I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Research Assistant in the [Innovatory for Cells and Neural Machines (ICAN)](https://schaterji.io/research/) Lab and the [Dependable Computing Systems Laboratory (DCSL)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) at Purdue University, advised by Prof. [Somali Chaterji](https://schaterji.io/) and Prof. [Saurabh Bagchi](https://bagchi.github.io/). I also collaborate closely with Prof. [Yin Li](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~yli/) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests include optimizing the performance and energy efficiency of Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) on diverse computing platforms, such as embedded GPUs, server GPUs, and AI ASIC chips. Recently, I have been working on several projects targeting performance and energy optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision (CV) applications on embedded/mobile GPUs. I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to address real-world problems, particularly through researching, developing, and deploying cutting-edge intelligent systems. My goal is to optimize latency, accuracy, and energy efficiency for intelligent computer systems, contributing to environmental sustainability.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m looking for an internship position to develop and deploy innovative Machine Learning systems in real-world applications.
